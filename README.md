# Mini Chat Application

A small Java project designed to practice and showcase different tools and concepts:
- **Git** for version control
- **Maven** for build and dependency management
- **Lombok** to reduce boilerplate code
- **Builder Design Pattern** for clean object creation
- **Socket Programming** to enable client-server communication
- **JSON** for structured data
- **Gson (Google JSON Library)** for JSON serialization and deserialization
- **Logging Frameworks (SLF4J + Logback)** for consistent and flexible logging

## üöÄ Project Goals
This project is not about building a full-scale application.  
Instead, it is a **one-week practice project** to strengthen my understanding of essential Java tools and frameworks.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Client can send and receive messages over sockets.
- Messages are structured in JSON format.
- Gson is used to convert Java objects to/from JSON.
- Lombok annotations reduce boilerplate code for models (e.g., `@Getter`, `@Builder`).
- Logging is implemented with SLF4J and Logback for clarity and debugging.
- Built and managed using Maven.
- Version controlled with Git.

## üìñ Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I practiced:
- Setting up and managing a GitHub repository.
- Configuring a Java project with Maven.
- Applying Lombok to simplify Java classes.
- Using the Builder design pattern.
- Implementing simple client-server communication with sockets.
- Working with JSON in Java using Gson.
- Writing clean log messages with SLF4J.
